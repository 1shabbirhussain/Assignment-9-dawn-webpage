            <h1>Hong Kong to ease coronavirus restrictions from Thursday</h1>
            <p>Hong Kong will ease strict coronavirus restrictions from Feb 18, re-opening sports and entertainment
                facilities and extending dining hours, Health Secretary Sophia Chan has said, as daily cases in the city
                dropped into single digits.
                <br>
                Chan, speaking at a news conference, said catering businesses would be able to operate until 10pm, from
                6pm
                now. Beauty salons, theme parks, cinemas and sports facilities would be allowed to resume, with
                conditions
                in place.
                <br>
                <q>We see there is room to gradually loosen social distancing measures, </q> she said, adding that
                swimming
                pools,
                nightclubs and mahjong parlours would remain shut. A ban on gatherings of more than two people in public
                places also remains in place.

            <h1>Dutch lawmakers debate new law backing coronavirus curfew</h1>
            <p>Dutch lawmakers are holding a debate on hastily drawn up legislation underpinning the country’s
                coronavirus curfew after a judge ordered the measure scrapped earlier this week, AP reports.
                <br>
                The lower house of parliament is expected to support the legislation, which would then go to the Senate
                on Friday — the same day that government lawyers go to court to appeal the order banning the 9pm to
                4:30am curfew.
                <br>
                The curfew, which sparked rioting last month but is very broadly supported and followed, remains in
                force pending the outcome of that appeal.</p>

            <h1>Brazil passes 10 million coronavirus infections</h1>
            <p>Brazil, the country with the second highest coronavirus death toll, passed the 10-million mark for
                reported infections, amid a deadly second wave and problems with its vaccination campaign.
                <br>
                The country became the third to reach the grim mark — after the United States and India — with more than
                51,900 new infections in 24 hours, according to official data. Over the same one-day period, 1,367
                people died, bringing the total to over 243,400.
                <br>
                Brazil's figure of 10,030,626 came amid mounting criticism of how President Jair Bolsonaro's government
                has handled the epidemic and a vaccination response, according to AFP.
                <br>
                So far, three per cent of the population of 212 million have received one of two required vaccine doses.

            <h1>US infectious disease expert hopes for return to normal by Christmas, in line with Biden target</h1>
            <p>Top US infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci said that a post-pandemic return to <q> normal</q>
                could come by the end of the year, aligning his forecast with a Christmas target US President Joe Biden
                set earlier this week.
                <br>
                Speaking to MSNBC, Fauci said there are many factors — including the emergence of variants of the
                coronavirus that are more contagious — that will influence when Americans can return to activities that
                have been stopped by the pandemic.
                <br>
                Americans might be able to get back to below capacity theaters and indoor dining “somewhere between the
                fall and the end of the year” while something much closer to life before the pandemic would likely be
                “as the president said, by the end of the year, by Christmas,” Fauci said.
                <br>
                <q> Maybe you’re going to still have to wear masks,</q> he noted.</p>

            <h1>Black and South Asian groups lag in Covid-19 vaccinations in the UK</h1>
            <p>
                Only 55 per cent of Black people in England in their 70s had been vaccinated against Covid-19 by last
                week compared to 86pc of white people of that age, a study showed, as celebrities and officials
                encourage minority groups to accept the shot, Reuters reported.
                <br>
                Britain has outpaced most other countries by giving at least one dose of coronavirus vaccine to more
                than a quarter of its population. However, people from Black and South Asian backgrounds, who have
                suffered a disproportionate number of deaths, have been more reluctant to be vaccinated.
                <br>
                Among those from South Asian backgrounds, 73pc of people aged 70-79 had been vaccinated by February 11,
                according to a study by OpenSafely, run by the University of Oxford and the London School of Hygiene and
                Tropical Medicine.
